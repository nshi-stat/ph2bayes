\title{The stopping boundaries based on Thall and Simon's criterion}
\usage{
stopbound_post(theta, type, nmax, alpha_e, beta_e, alpha_s, beta_s, delta)
}
\arguments{
\item{theta}{the cutoff probability: typically, \eqn{\theta = [0.95, 0.99]} for superiority, \eqn{\theta = [0.01, 0.05]} for futility.}

\item{type}{type of boundaries: "superiority" or "futility".}

\item{nmax}{the maximum number of patients treated by the experimental drug.}

\item{alpha_e}{the hyperparameter (shape1) of the Beta prior for the experimental drug.}

\item{beta_e}{the hyperparameter (shape2) of the Beta prior for the experimental drug.}

\item{alpha_s}{the hyperparameter (shape1) of the Beta prior for the standard drug.}

\item{beta_s}{the hyperparameter (shape2) of the Beta prior for the standard drug.}

\item{delta}{the minimally acceptable increment of the response rate for the experimental drug compared with the standard drug.
Note: if type = "superiority", then delta is set to 0.}
}
\value{
\item{boundset}{the boundaries set; \eqn{U_n} or \eqn{L_n}}
}
